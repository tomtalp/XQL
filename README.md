# XQL
XQL transforms any Excel file into an actual RDBMS, with SQL capabilities!
Once the user picks an Excel file, the file can be queried via SQL just like a regular database.
The Excel file is treated as the database, and every sheet is respectively treated as a table in the DB.

XQL makes data analysis operations on large Excel files with multiple sheets much easier!
